<b>Title: Eat Out to Help Out</b>
<br />
An immersive multimedia WebVR political comic, exploring the controversial story of the UK government’s ‘Eat Out to Help Out” subsidised dining scheme during the Covid pandemic (2020). 100 million meals were eaten, but then deaths spiked ...
<br />
The artwork is built using A-frame, which is an open-source entity component system framework for Three.js where developers can create 3D and WebVR scenes using HTML and javascript. 
<br />
The artwork should be viewed on the Desktop in a WebGL-compatible browser, eg Chrome or Firefox. 
<br />
This version of the artwork was designed to be viewed on the Desktop, rather than a VR headset (though it would work with a headset). It can be viewed on the browser either in standard mode, with a white background, or by selecting the VR button in the bottom right corner of the browser to show the VR view, which has a transparent background (appears as black, and arguably looks better).
<br />
Please navigate the story from left to right, across the screen. The camera view shows where you are in the scene, and is represented by a small black circle. Moving this camera view around the scene will trigger different sounds, which have precise positions in the A-frame scene.
<br />
There is one scene only, which tells the whole story over 360 degrees. There are no links out of the scene, the work is contained within this page.
